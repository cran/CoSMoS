\description{
Generates timeseries with given properties, just provide (1) the target marginal
distribution and its parameters, (2) the target autocorrelation structure or
individual autocorrelation values up to a desired lag, and (3) the probablility
zero if you wish to simulate an intermittent process.
}
\details{
A step-by-step guide:
\itemize{
\item First define the target marginal (margdist), that is, the probability distribution
of the generated data. For example set margdist = 'ggamma' if you wish to generate
data following the Generalized Gamma distribution, margidst = 'burrXII' for Burr
type XII distribution etc. For a full list of the distributions we support see the
help vignette: \code{vignette('vignette', package = 'CoSMoS')}. In general, the package
supports all build-in distribution functions of R and of other packages.
\item Define the parametersâ€™ values (margarg) of the distribution you selected. For example
the Generalized Gamma has one scale and two shape parameters so set the desired value,
e.g., margarg = list(scale = 2, shape1 = 0.9, shape2 = 0.8). Note distributions might
have different number of parameters and different type of parameters (location, scale, shape).
To see the parameters of each distribution we support, see the help vignette:
\code{vignette('vignette', package = 'CoSMoS')}.
\item If you wish your time series to be intermittent (e.g., precipitation), then define the
probability zero. For example, set p0 = 0.9, if you wish your generated data to have
90\\% of zero values (dry days).
\item Define your linear autocorrelations.
\itemize{
\item You can supply specific lag autocorrelations starting from lag 0
and up to a desired lag, e.g., acs = c(1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7); this will generate
a process with lag1, 2 and 3 autocorrelations equal with 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7.
\item Alternatively, you can use a parametric autocorrelation structure (see section 3.2 in
\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.02.013}{Papalexiou 2018}).
We support the following autocorrelation structures (acs) weibull, paretoII,
fgn and burrXII. See also \link[CoSMoS]{acs} examples.
}
\item Define the order to the autoregressive model p. For example if you aim to preserve
the first 10 lag autocorrelations then just set p = 10. Otherwise set it p = NULL and
the model will decide the value of p in order to preserve the whole autocorrelation
structure.
\item Lastly just define the time series length, e.g., n = 1000 and number of time series
you wish to generate, e.g., TSn = 10.
}

Play around with the following given examples which will make the whole
process a piece of cake.
